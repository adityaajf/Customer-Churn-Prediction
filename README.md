# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)
Predict which customers are likely to stop using a service. This allows businesses to target retention efforts and minimize revenue loss.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their service or relationship with a company. By identifying customers at risk of churn, businesses can proactively implement targeted retention strategies, minimizing revenue loss and enhancing customer satisfaction. 

The project will involve collecting and preparing customer data, extracting relevant features, training a predictive model using supervised learning algorithms, and evaluating its performance through rigorous testing.  The insights gained from the model will be used to understand key churn drivers and develop personalized retention strategies, ultimately contributing to improved customer loyalty and business growth. 


Technical Details: 

Use supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), or Decision Trees trained on historical customer data (demographics, usage patterns, billing history, etc.). Feature engineering is crucial to capture relevant patterns.
